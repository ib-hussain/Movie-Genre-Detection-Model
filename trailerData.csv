it's all over the united states probably the world on the on board as i recall it was very early in the morning until o'clock or something like that it was like and a family reunion you know being in one spot what always great jazz musicians that one time damion that we would we go big dogs i mean the giants were their prayers mark i looked around and it was counter a sock charlie means gov smith dizzy gillespie joy not and i said nana can you imagine if everybody had their instruments and play   back in nineteen fifty eight a new york with still the jazz couple of the world you could important music all of a town representing an extraordinary range of periods of styles this film is the story of a magic moment when dozens of the greatest jazz stars of all time gathered for an astonishing photograph that's the style of i guess and now the summer nineteen fifty eight in which time i was not a photographer arcane went from this day to become a leading player in the feel of photography this was his first picture i was an art director fairly well known or during as art director of the seventeen magazine he was one of the two or three really great young art director of the day henry walk and arcane in one or two other people were really considered the the the bright young for robert bitten had not yet become the celebrated hollywood film maker he had only just begun esquire's new art director of the pleases jazz fan boss with an idea for an all jazz issue but his inexperience combined with canes and experience gave us this historic document i was new enough and done enough and knows days that i was was willing to try all sorts of of a risky thing so that suggests to against it was hell hayes who is the editor at the time he well you aren't can and chance of the is really never worked before it professionally but scale a lot of talent and now he loves jazz you know i i called are that ask him if he would come and talk to hero and photograph is sick so i suggest that we start this story off with the gigantic spread whereby we get together every jazz musician we can possibly assemble that instead of doing it in a controlled situation is judy i didn't have a studio i was not even a professional photographer stewart are then said he want to you it up in harlem where jazz came in and new york that with that was omar where i began to get very nervous to that we will never be able to control up here and so began a great day and have ah you know anything about how you got them jersey who told you become how you showed up so early know whatever you remember about the davis sink thinking how you happen to be standing up there with those guys try to begin our staying up and man the hundred fifty third street radicals were obviously about the to the taxes now i came with tab jordan and of genuine on were left me all came together a nice day to about two hours i guess i had to would have had topic come around saying not want to have your picture taken her esquire magazine be and lennox avenue and whatever it was hundred twenty fifth grade i hate this loser a remarkable idea and that's why i showed up there like i was so fascinated with the idea when i say i can't believe i'm doing his job because they were full time with a cold war i can remember about level ten that's early that's probably why didn't believe anybody show  in those a you know most musicians in my son's birthday get the bed so for clock in the morning and you know one didn't go to sleep immediately turn on time thinking of the days have any and say you up gerber a row twelve or one ravenously hungry cover of because of theory wonder you know well you're own to deal with for a long day go  in i was hanging around with blue line swivel by that time so i came down with it was only later on and i realize that this was for esquire and were the most of the rest of these people were because at that time i was really only interested in stride and   when you hear voicing like this  will arise       lucky roberts so was one of the first stride pianist lucky was in his time i have a legendary pianos there was nobody where the reach in the imagination i mean the line was good but lucky was the strike wrong  he was five foot two or five foot four seven he was very short but he was very powerful story he was a gymnast were earlier on there is a story that was reported it and rudy blushes book they all played ragtime that we're lucky roberts was walking alone at night and these young thugs we're gonna love him and he succeeded and and grabbing both of them breaking their bones and dragging them into the police station   i don't know why they picked this particular street or this brownstone with that was a case in his where the of in school round i think i was residing at pop collins i'll switches a notorious home for musicians were you could come eat and sleep for a reasonable some i think is dinners with thirty five cents apiece and they were out of sight and the runes might have been less see know my them and nine eight or nine dollars a week it was important for me to live in new york because i was just building a reputation for

welcoming kind pay so little of this to a little of that watch what's going on i lived in the kitchen my grandmother was a fabulous cook ran this kitchen did most of the cooking herself would grind her own meet clean your own chickens get fresh eggs so this is in upstate new york in the fifties in there is a lot of fresh produce available from the farmers and there's an orchard next door and there is a dairy farm across road need all seem to fit together my grandmother always made a deal out of the presentation of the food that always a that run it i was gonna try again later told to be beautiful silver platter they were huge is probably stainless feel that it it was great time i've always been drawn to make food so i got my first job when i was seventeen my first real job was his bagel maker and there's something about baking i think i know i just like eating the baked goods more than anything else so i went to college i worked my way not through college my parents help but i always get jobs in the food veers i would get a job a short order cook would get a job as a pizza maker and get a job making donuts you know the midnight shift baking donors so i kept going back to bakery they bakery and later marion i who were living together and a third friend nan decided to open up a bakery we thought we could to let him so we opened bread and shop in nineteen eighty it wasn't until i had read and chocolate for many many years maybe five or six years standing there doing with wrote work of running the business is being scared of going out of business making croissants that occurred to me that i was in show business and net impact and had a lot in common in show his theater show business music and baking all appeal to the same thing   and fact the people mostly kid walking back and all the sudden it was like they were enhance their mouths would drop open their eyes with get be they would see the big mixers in the oven that revolved in the big freezers and the refrigerators just the scale of everything the tables we have our big than in your home kitchens at home a big that forty gallon cans for chocolate chips whole wheat flour oat bran wheat bran sugar salt brown sugar all the different ingredients in the big bucket to boil honey and molasses     people watch their name being written on a cake or their mother's name happy mother's day mom they see it being written in they see the flowers being put on the cake you feel your part of the feel like you're involved because he got to see it in the eat you get store that away and for children of course that's their whole life is made of images that have impact that's the high point of their childhood they'll never forget him i try to provide that it's bakery every single day for children who come in for adults who come in         people   that aspect of the theater it's like having a play but hadn't the same audience every day it's like having an ongoing play you see fat people come in who are eating way too much in your heart goes out them because they ask something and you know in your heart that the they shouldn't be eating it and am i contributing to their downfall but then you see other people runners come in they only eat out brand methods a one know how many milligrams of fat or in something i think this is just as bad as a fat person eating a brownie is this person being so fanatically neurotic about god forbid they should get a little bit of butterfat nearby today it's a slow them down a quarter of a tenth of a second in a ten k race i mean you see it all and your heart goes out to all these people it's a very good practice you know the buddhist call it a practice whatever it is you're doing and the bakery the food business i have no regrets about it's right work it's right livelihood and i feel very good about what i do it provides a lot of opportunities for insight into all of life not just into recipes from muffins or croissant the  we have a special gift in that we have the same clientele day in and day out and because of that we get to the long term relationships we are part of the community people are born and bred and chocolate but essentially they are babies come in when they are week old with their mothers your mother start shooting and having tea and shoes on the other mothers so babies consciousness children from their earliest ages britain chocolate is a part of their life and important part they get their cakes they get your read your mother goes there when i feel better when if you're unhappy they want something from the

Switchblade_Sisters_(1975)_1xIuWPSIpnw.mp4,Switchblade Sisters (1975),,hi i'm jack hill and this is trailers from hill i'm introducing here switchblades sisters which was a film i made in nineteen seventy four so and has since become a cult classic like so many of my friends and or the trailer is interesting because it's a very unusual trailer in that is rather long for a trail it's almost a kind of a mini film in itself and i've seen it's screened to few times at film festivals and it actually gets applause yes which played sisters i would like to mention that the voice over the narrator for this trailer is my a good old faithful running ganz who i used many many times and creating trailers he has a kind of especially here you can hear what i think it was the way around sort of curls his voice on certain words he has a tone that almost sounds lewd and lascivious even a lecherous of times i used him and all my own trailers and i made their teachers were scared the cops couldn't tabor this trailer i did not actually cut myself but i wrote a script for sometimes specially with trailers less really is more what that was a mistake in this case it was because i the director of the movie that is just couldn't resist putting in a lot of my favorite moments the actresses in this movie a very interesting the casting as were interesting and the action the roller vaccine has become a classic seen another applause get her screenings zero was shot and just a few hours slap together an improvised at the time i was really disappointed because i didn't have nearly enough time to do it right who knows if i had enough time and might not have become a classic sometimes the spontaneity and things like this can be more interesting than something carefully plan i've had that happen and some other films which i've had to shoot i'm very very tight schedules some of the action scenes were just thrown together very quickly become very very popular to this movie about a gang of go girls who kick out the boys take over it was actually distributed for many many years as a lesbian cult film on home video which when i found that out it was a great surprise to me and it was supposed to be actually a little bit political maybe the original title for this film was actually the judge rebels which was the name of the girls gang that they chose for themselves when the film first open none of that title of the box office was very poor and some of the theater owners were coming back saying i thought that maybe in the advertisements in the paper people were getting it confused with the old movie called jazz a bell from the forties this is a very controversial seen for example in the film where are the girl gets raped by the the good bad guy and actually a sort of seems to enjoy it and becomes his girlfriend later and i took a lot of criticism for that scene but actually the fact is that i stole it right out of the fountainhead also from a time when i was working in the philippines when i heard and old ladies ta about getting raped and she says well you know depends on who's doing it so i took a lot of flak for that still do with screenings today the film was released and oddly enough has now become a great famous cult classic and i don't really know why switchblade sisters is a story of today maybe a little bit of tomorrow  ,Switchblade_Sisters_(1975)_1xIuWPSIpnw.wav

they would open fire  seven has come in and in the first few days after my son was killed one that many friends colleagues and students came to express their sympathy with the law but they all said that soon the official verdict would be overturned because he may thought you said as investigations and arrest began fewer and fewer people came to see me jin that mean people ran into me they were silent fuck it was as though nothing had ever happened events do not deliver their meanings to us they are always interpreted on the morning of june fifth there was a moment that would come to symbolize the hope and the tragedy of those spring days he disappeared into the crowd afterwards and no one knows where he is now no one is even certain of his name but for the millions who saw this seen all over the world it's meaning it was clear here was human hope encourage challenging the remorseless machinery of state power the chinese government interpreted the same just simply but differently so you're thought behind they wonder that changing my phone call about a lot the coffee or tea vamos you're going to other june twenty charge a job i don't know how show me with that jean

history  tiananmen the gate of heavenly peace is the gate leading into the imperial city for centuries the center of power in china in nineteen nineteen though the emperor had long been overthrown students gathered at ten am and to denounce the government's failure to stand up to foreign powers their protests spread quickly through the country and came to be known as the may fourth movement here's a student demonstrations followed despite violin government repression arrests and killings generation after generation the students came out to protest inspiring other chinese to follow them china was in danger and corrupt officials didn't care young intellectuals felt they must place their lives on the line to awaken the people they aim to save the nation to democracy and modern science and the discarding of oppressive traditions when the great change did come it came from the countryside a peasant army led in part by people who had participated in the student protests mouse moussa dawns communist army entered a chain and nineteen forty nine national power returned to the city and to channel men the traditional rumors of china had always remained hidden behind the close gates of the imperial city when now appeared before the people that top ten and then he reversed centuries of symbolism the center of power was visibly shifted from the imperial city behind the gate to the broad masses in front of facing the leader who stood above the water had their share that can cause a for the founding ceremonies of the people's republic of china in nineteen forty nine that him and squares full of weeds as high as your waist i hope they bad students for that aging and to your universities volunteered to clear away all the we're somehow shamble so what yes yes it was students them to logo so than a good thing there days at that time young people were very enthusiastic about the people's liberation army and about the revolution what is it was a tenement that the people's republic of china was founded in who was it was young woman that maoist the chinese people have stood up      so i sell shovel me when i was a child i went to tiananmen twice a year for the parades for them martha it allows they do it on tenants annual and to haunt the one after the parade had passed a huge crowd of children russia to the gate showed enjoy no words trust the sound of children's voices created the desired effect waterfront so i was one of those children i would weigh flowers are released for loans are dogs now wave his hand like jack i'd offer hi from canada and that time oh dear many communist leaders moved into quarters with in the old imperial city yeah that's easier and before they had lived with the peasants to and it was a fish cannot live out of water but after the revolution if a peasant went into the city to look up a leader he had known in the past he wouldn't be able to find them the water could no longer find the fish the fish were inside the palace and now himself became only fail to the emperor hailed as a man who i would live forever doesn't that of course i was unable to see it like this in the nineteen fifties in the nineteen fifties the government ordered the building of a great square in front of ten am and to accommodate the masses several of china's later leaders first came to prominence as dedicated model workers in the building of the square the gigantic square would become the largest public space in the world and the center of chinese political life on one side of it was built a great hall of the people on the other a museum of history and the revolution in the center of the square stood the monument commemorating the martyrs of the revolution a tombstone of the great did which consecrate the square as sacred ground the monument to pick scenes from chinese history since eighteen forty there are no recognizable individuals collectively they represent the people among the ancestors of new china pictured on the monument or the students of may fourth nineteen nineteen protesting before the gate itself drink that woman's this leads also do it all when the students of nineteen eighty nine occupy gentlemen square of they made their headquarters here beneath images of other students to change trials history consciously associating themselves with the tradition of student protest in china why their own actions they were adding further meaning to this place the place and all of china was charged with me  good morning beloved geeky good morning beloved going on man gate of heavenly peace in males era to man became the symbol of the new china the gay and the square the people and the leader who express the people will can a man had once led into the imperial palace now it was the focus of mouse square now and tiananmen for one  you know may want to know where the somehow heatley entangled with the lives of the chinese people it's a contender this was because under the communist party everyone's life became involved with politics  the mythology what you do when i graduated from university and nineteen sixty six i sincerely believed what i was taught that i was a brand new book to be used in the construction of the great mansion of communism yeah i was willing to be put wherever my country needed money and i was prepared to say and place my whole life to name always like god i believe that he was not only the great leader of the chinese people are it also the great leader of people throughout the world i think we're the day when he would no longer us i really hope there be a scientific breakthrough that would enable young people like us to voluntarily give up a year of our lives to add a minute to his in federal law that way the world would be saved your     in nineteen seventy six now died between an earthquake and a solar eclipse traditional portents of the end of an era at the funeral the great throng face ten a man but the place where now had stood was empty all of the leaders remain on a platform below mouse still resides in the square the mausoleum built in nineteen seventy seven at the south end of the square is not a so much as a grand villa it contains a huge marble armchair for the chairman and a bid to where he lives laws little slower he didn't shed a single tear when my daughter or be cheap in modest on it out i'd been cheated your did you had never visited the mamata liam it's so disgusting now is dead but not gone the great portrait that hangs on a still presides over every parade and celebration held in the great square during the student demonstrations of nineteen eighty nine three men from our own home province of hunan splattered the great portrait with ink the students immediately distance themselves from this act they denounce the outrage and helped arrest the man responsible shortly after the desecration gale force winds blew and torrents of rain fell on the square somebody will actually wondered was the chairman displeased within hours the portrait was replaced but it is not only mouse face his vision of history is language his actions still loom large and china's imagination you sound like one hundred the seat homemade communism is actually a promise of something perfect weather encounter it's easy for people who are dissatisfied with all the imperfections that realize that should be attracted to it cannot hold onto any during the nineteen thirties and forties many people were drawn to the communist party because they wanted to escape the ugly reality you gosh and they longed for the promise throughout the first decade of the revolution that promise had the support of large segments of society now provided the vision of an ideal society but he had little interest in the day to day work of bringing in about that was left to his associates among them was dung shopping a mother them the bachelor she that long now had the personality of a romantic poet jungle that have a pragmatist a top you cannot a puritanical theoretician or an idealist he's different from our in that he knows that when people are hungry they need to eat before they can't live on poetry function and during the nineteen fifties more launched wave after wave of prosecutions against people who have different views my nineteen fifty nine no one dared express any dissenting opinions anymore katrina he had to have the last word on everything and people would have tolerated it if his policies it worked out well see that he made a mess of things millions of people starved to death for that so his comrades had to help patch things up to keep up with what this meant as like retreat from mars i'm hoping my illusions huge don't like to quote sichuan proverb it doesn't matter whether a cat is black and white if it catches mice it's a good cat but mouse solution when things went wrong was always more revolution not less he saw anyone who stood between him and his masses as an enemy is so bureaucrats and lingering bourgeois elements undermining the original promise of the revolution against the government bureaucracy mount mobilized as masses a fresh uprising of the people the only source of progress male called it a cultural revolution the people were enjoying damn in ju mass democracy chaos can't harm us he proclaimed it can only harm our enemies just   mel lost control of the cultural revolution it became a war of or against all don't show hey was among those attacked now stripped him of his power they brought him back to repair a shattered society like those and howard who had experienced mouse mass democracy doesn't show things greatest fear would be don't want turmoil chaos upheaval when the students of nineteen eighty nine to two the streets they too were branded as stirring up to one many leaders in the government's saw them in the light of the past they were a throwback to the horrors of the cultural revolution that it nearly destroyed china the one that won't bother coming at the end of the cultural revolution the chinese economy was on the verge of bankruptcy that system what could be done badly think you know he's were don't show shopping was really smart you'll see yeah he's prescription was capitalism peter like reform and opening up actually meant learning from capitalism but he couldn't say that outright because capitalism was supposed to be our arch enemy now how could you turn around and learn from our enemy lama they need help you said then came up with something called socialism with chinese characteristics so quickly have you followed his instincts you got first and foremost the people didn't have enough to eat they had to be fed okay secondly the people who had been politically wrong had to be exonerated these were very practical things little did he know what tremendous changes would be triggered once this process began it was deep winter nineteen seventy nine when i saw began to be felt a stretcher bearer wall near the city centre became a place

a new dictator waging strong was framed and sentenced to fifteen years he was still in prison when the students came to ten a man and nineteen eighty nine to demand democracy few of them knew his story that's one china if you want to express your opinion and you had to speak from within the communist party than one on one that the you mind if we talked outside they throw you in jail jordan you are not friends who the resembling the only option for a pure idealist to commit suicide would ya know that was you and i once wrote an essay entitled commit suicide and save the country what do we visited of course it didn't pass up the sensors ago always going to court wasn't good enough for that i completely lost faith in the communist party i thought the only workable thing was to join up and try and change it committing suicide myself wouldn't do the country much good a more useful thing to do was to help the communist party commit suicide then minimum taught us as the easiest way to take a fortress was from within and he was on how the trojan horse and ancient greece if you can't went through confrontation with you have to try sneaking inside bunch of energy for you and time

to execute them it would be called the ground architect or form by downside when his loyal ministers who you're bon jour see young men given the task of reform men who can also be blamed when reform went too far some students in the parade raised a homemade banner greeting down by his first name hello xiaoping an unheard of liberty people were genuinely grateful to done china's industry is advancing toward modernization like agriculture it will soon be carried forward on the wave of reform the reforms brought weight and dramatic change in the countryside communes were broken up rural markets were revived farmers started to make money there was a lot more money to be made  the old man in charge would change in china the results were going to be seen everywhere after decades of relative isolation china was looking out into the world just a handful all the enticements of capitalism back   our life is getting better and better the light industry float shows how life is becoming more colorful as are living standards rise  your boss in the national day celebrations in nineteen eighty four you were an elaborate enthusiastic affair many people saw a bright future and norwegian one so what are local news article but why did my friends and i can so depressed something we won the overcast sky the loan figure of dung shopping popping out of that car running stirring things don't turn on avenue where the guy i thought of all voted ill for the future growth settlement that kind of it was the heritage of the now arrows it wasn't embodiment of revolution you have to go meet and for us revolution was made up of a small number of ambitious political career on the one hand cool torso and the frenzied masses on the other you're it trying to lose the and we were fed up with all that a measure of economic prosperity had been achieved by nineteen eighty four wasn't where we saw countless different will defend it begins anew and we didn't know how heavy price the chinese people might still have to pay it was local local new with with puts them at all i could do was to help change things bit by bit kind of authorities i knew i couldn't make that much difference but that didn't matter because there was nothing else we're doing anyway  singing and dancing a million and a half people in the capital attend the grand national day evening carnival  the carnival even will forever remain in our memories come to see tiananmen come to see our country and five years' time      the   on may twenty eighth nineteen eighty nine a student leader named chai ling requested an interview with an american journalist tournaments square was then occupied by students martial law had been declared no one knew what might happen the interview was recorded with a home video camera these may be my last words because the situation is becoming very grim my name is timing i am twenty three years old oddly enough my birthday is i for fifteen the day we are both died hu yaobang had been the general secretary of the party and dung show pings chosen successor public morning for who would last for a week and will become the ground from which all the demonstrations of nineteen eighty nine would grow in many ways the movement is not very mature opportunity presented itself accidentally talking to you know what the nuclear bomb was going to die when he did this movement is a great manifestation of the natural democratic instincts of the students and the people are spontaneous expression of the people's own interests i've come into contact with people from all walks of life they feel they have no security many have gone overseas or feel this country's finished it's going to die who your bong had been removed from power two years before his death he'd been accused of leaning towards bush one liberalism known for tested openly one who was purged but now people claim him as a champion of enlightened rule morning for him became a cover for protest against those still in power or as it was set at the time the men who should drop dead are still alive yet the man who should be alive is did in the world or in chinese culture a phenomenon called the coat of the dead local musicians or the soil than issue with a after them all the man's flaws you've forgotten and his memory is enshrined in the halo we laura the whole because of that the so on the way then people use the dead man to vent their anger and express their hopes these guys usually over young it was clear to me that people weren't simply concerned with one man's death it's like wonder well was to youngsters who your bonds death made it possible for a crowd together in a public place it either your the you gave them some going to discuss and she's hiding in a while and that led to discussions of all kinds of other issues lot harsher most of the talking was about our own lives what obama goes yala for each my parents kept saying much were you in the past all the wages are low young wants you to raise your three children i read this or come these days even when they're holding a job when he is a new are always your in the money go don't show things reforms which had been so popular were disappointing a lot of people by the end of the eighties workers could no longer count on lifelong employment the iron rice bowl and the socialists safety net of medical benefits and pensions was being dismantled the child of our movie actors that trouble paying their workers off for the jago really kicked out a bunch of people does your they didn't use the word fire because there reprioritising the workforce you want all these things came with reform shade ordered outside been doing show where everyone knows what happened in the early stages of capitalism for melodrama her jewelry usual the competition with savage and there was no protection for the weekend will roger i don't yada will room in the quest for profits there was a total disregard for the impact on the society and the environment gonna leave a children feel for you this is exactly what's happening in china right now our share that with guy named go to go about doing that we're in a transitional period where the room and that see all for the the reforms are necessary or but the workers have to protect their own interests to get rich was glorious said the government that those who got my were mostly people in power and insiders who would always done well only government and industry cod could work the turnover buying goods it fixed government prices and selling them on the free market it a big profit more than anything else workers complained of corruption you never told the officials take can take i'm at so why can't we have a them you have a knock on when we take were called criminals and we now take your not a sure sure and shit people needed to vent their anger in a yeah but they were worried because so many had been persecuted in the past just for speaking out in a crowd they felt it was safe to let off steam for often someone would rant and rave and and quickly disappear back into the around the world but i felt that the reason for a lot of my suffering was that hardly anyone took responsibility for what they said or do it you'll be all usury i thought i should try and set an example of them so i told people my name on every it order to show that i was prepared to face consequences for what i said you're young guy i wanted to ending filter people that to change society from the had to starve yourself students and intellectuals had been among the strongest supporters of the reforms yet after a decade of economic growth they enjoyed few of the benefits beijing you your hodges that there's a saying in beijing chong there's and your as poor as a professor there are those and as dumb as a phd usage it was piled are you gonna do that was really true to show that no matter how hard you weren't like when you get anywhere on your lap kids okay there is something really wrong with the reforms those in power have benefited from them not the people although there are superficial economic prosperity the masses and the intellectuals have been deprived have any hope for initiative  what lost why   it locked  the communist party had always defined min joon democracy in just this way the people in charge but a real democracy was to be implemented how were the peak of the take charge don't go it's i'm not a final finally china is so huge and communications are so bad even if you were to call national election tomorrow how many people know whom to vote for robot you shine you conditions i'm going to rival around leave to that stage and democracy what people did know whom they wanted to elect in their local communities so open elections were already possible the village level nothing when this form of democracy became more retain when we could introduce broader elections on the county level and then higher and higher up those of us who are working for jobs a young push for this type of grassroots level democratic election limit on the weekend and of course the hardline communist immediately saw this as a threat to their powers to determine that we see so they were dead set against it the weekend in the the candles no then as for the intellectual is that they said typical grassroots democracy is not important world is that what we want to determine the fate of china we are not just the fate of a village account hundred and six or we had trouble getting support students dissatisfied with the status quo might have taken up the hard work of building democracy at the local level or they might have organized to demand redress of their own grievances as underpaid and undervalued intellectual workers but that's not what interested most students they talked as chinese students have always taught of saving china well on the future reference death was caused by the mental stress resulting from is illegal removal from office and other news google one we thought commemorating one man was not going to help china and you the word hundred ninety sure what ruminative all to ensure our nation's positive development we're just are transforming the political system do with you on and we wanted to use this opportunity to put forth our political demands truth the whole thing around midnight on april seventeenth were set up from beijing university we carried a banner that read his soul of china  for sure but on the morning of the eighteenth over thousand students held a meeting in the square bob   the student settled on seven demands and wrote up a petition they carried the petition to various government offices and chinois man the entrance to the old palace compound were china's top leaders live and work the students waited for an answer  the students surge towards the gate a number of times so i went over to the big red columns already i called out to them from an hour will cause you to i'm a worker

organizing committee cruise with how they became the leaders because they were courageous enough to step forward and moving on there were no formal elections going to avoid whom he says or to leave one goal later the committee made many efforts to organize elections but because we constantly faced new crises we couldn't do what we'd originally intended to boot fuckin organizing committee is appeared on many beijing campuses and within days formed a citywide coalition of independent student unions hello oh no before dawn on april twenty second students gathered at ten am and for who your bonds official funeral the list of their grievances have lengthened with every passing day two and morning and his name was acquiring greater significance  wow oh yeah well now  the and that gives the earth on april twenty second the memorial ceremony for who he elbowed was held in the great hall of the people no no our thinking hope you know when i entered new you i felt that the atmosphere is very grim more like a ceremony see memory now and after party secretary general zhao ziyang with the universe the world leaders from the central committee restaurants    i thought oh when i came out of the great hall of the people i saw a huge crowd gathered and gentlemen desire to handle or seattle i wanted to go over to them but they wouldn't and i'm rooms of police standing between us the students had brought their petition and demanded that leap on the prime minister come out to accept it himself when we saw classmates kneeling they're holding the petition with raised arms everyone cried the less in it where our suggestions to the government but we had to hand it in wheeling down no one paid any attention no one came forward to accept it or do go to good theory that he has some we all saw those three students are the issue with we workers film premier you should come out need to go you should accept the petition and events through their demands i'm a your even if you don't really you should at least make some gesture but the premier just left to that you completely ignored the suitable did you know how do you have people to take that i would you can get the have been how could the government employees so callous the pay your hot and visit there many of us who had just gathered inside the great home had taken part in student movements when we were young with my said that yeah so why when you're treating the students this way now shooting in a changing there during those early days of the student movement do we pleaded with the authorities idea petition them like in loyal subjects in traditional china your would gg at first we made direct appeals then we pleaded with tears and on bended needed to move quickly gillette yes we were even willing to kneel down before that ended june like subjects petitioning the emperor have you don't have a woman whom and what we had to beg them to come out and talk to us dollar the original interests and this huge on eg good then again it's fair to say that the government virtually crumbled under the weight of our needs to to the balloon one and down there with these students were the a now with the very same things we had a posing in our youth with more mentioned that you want you to be turned into a party which was against the people are including size shoes and the that are what is today is not the same communist party i had once joined good evening thousands of chinese students took to the streets today in defiance of a government ban on public protests the student chant was for democracy their demands for political reform the backdrop was a memorial service for fallen leader who yeah yaobang longitudinal were doing harsher than i was in new york my time here and or two more boardroom with this sort of news was on television and in the papers every day the new year the rules and were a year usually ubuntu me when friends got together or we talked about where these events they didn't shoot they does sure that involved in the tv images that affected me deeply what what i would i thought on that what's the use of getting all worked up about your so far away i had to go back so i got on a plane leaving new york on april twenty six rewards that when i was changing planes in tokyo i met someone who are just come from china you said what do you think you can do that cleared or haven't you heard about the editorial but just appeared in short order them will hold it's cause the movement a lot by a small handful to instigate anti party and estate you don't want to work dumb luann turmoil upheaval chaos a people's daily editorial denounced the demonstrations we must on a quickly oppose dumb luann the headline read such an editorial appearing in the official communist party media amounted to a charge of criminal conspiracy they are walk on what we would have either you come down from while it was dangerous for me to go back to will hire me with i even asked about the lights returning to new york what if you're the other guy heard saying you should have another one movie that the road but then i heard the boarding and outside for my flight have a genuine page of the in and uk encourage them to do with you not going to change a whole i didn't have time to has a job yards a your i had to get on that plane to shop is you who you walk i thought what the heck live or die but i'll just go will show third usually fabio to play with the april twenty second the editorial challenge the government took affirms it and against the student movement did you're going on how do you go to the communist party has a tradition of passing judgement on social incidents through the media i really my fighters and easier when war removable thousand a had written quite a few people's daily editorials himself under your pack jones your free time for lot of the he launched a number of mass political prosecutions this way was a that's what i like april twenty six editorial came out and fabio people is rather was represented dunks attitude toward the student demonstrations to go struggle to use use everyone expected that the government would crack down on any new a demonstration china little should that freeze how since we were very angry is which is what petty minor to be my you got these people in the government have gone completely haywire just something you yet you will by shares just listen to what they're saying it was solid it sounds like the cultural revolution all over again what's wasn't home here come the that's your mindset is even the words were identical to the editorial which came out after the t i'm an incident of nineteen seventy six doesn't yeah do you want that we all live through that episode women tortured on the that don't need a chemist as your whole a we know how that ended up the editorial on april twenty six reminded many people what happened after another great state funeral the events of nineteen seventy six known to everyone as they can i'm an incident in january of nineteen seventy six premier joe and line mouse close associate one of the great heroes of the revolution died the people of the capital could not restrain give it to agree they live their home and gathered on the sidewalks of the chung on boulevard along which the court case with pounds joe was widely regarded as a moderate more humane and tolerant than other top leaders just as the morning for who your bong and nineteen eighty nine was the occasion for protest the outpouring of grief for joe like was a reproach to the hardliners in power on you stop for a moment the of crimea they in turn on men don't you remember the many deprecation we celebrated here together your ringing love is clearly not year you're only gave read on or tears build up it premiered job how we miss you how we need you  the times when important leaders die or dangerous joe and lie was a mentor of don't show him he helped bring back into government to counter the excesses of the cultural revolution doug gave the eulogy at joe's funeral the good game in yeah but the events following jones density would once again he bring down shut down that april during the traditional festival and honor the dead thousands of people gathered spontaneously enchantments square to lay wreaths in honor of joe and lie they read palms gave speeches reports made to mouse of the agitation was really directed against him police removed the reads but people brought more police order the crowds to disperse the crowds overturned a police van and said at a fire at last match book action workers aren't with clubs were sent in there were beatings and arrests in the official press the events in the square where denounced as counter revolutionary violence and spire by a small handful of conspirators the alleged mastermind behind the turmoil was that unrepentant reactionary dung shopping  dung was denounced condemned forced from power not until after mouse death with he emerges china's new paramount leader then the verdict on the nineteen seventy six upheavals would be reversed the scenes and gentlemen square with the were playing with a different meaning they became courageous demonstrations of the people's will and yet now in nineteen eighty nine the government of don't shout king faced again with protests inspired by the death of a leader reach for the own words of denunciation once again the supreme leader heard reports that the agitation was directed against him once again a small handful of conspirators were supposedly plotting to bring down the state once again the irrevocable judgment is past  food order to the editorial of april twenty six them cause the students by total surprise you so much with we didn't expect that the government would jump to such a vicious conclusion about us was on the we felt that without large scale street action that we couldn't compete with the propaganda machine of the government and the people wouldn't know the truth about what we were doing the chinese constitution guarantees the people free speech and the right to demonstrate but chinese law punish his counter revolutionary instigation by the enemies of the people the final arbiter was the communist party where the students the people are where they know enemies of the people who must be suppressed the you also completely you i got together with some friends to talk about the situation you mean all of us were teachers at various universities we heard that some huge numbers of police will be deployed the next day in hell thought this really worried us we decided to demonstrate with our students and get your are your we found that we must show where we stood at a moment like this  in the early morning of april twenty seventh student said out from campuses all over the city and walked toward gentleman square the political center of china  police were placed on alert rob aging and position to block a t intersections along the route lot of through the can we were prepared to face great danger some students even wrote their wills this was because we had heard that the government was moving and troops to suppress any further demonstrations if you're using feed everyone showed a lot of self control since the government had accused us of instigating turmoil we were eager to show the people that we weren't a lawless mob know are we trying to overthrow the communist party or socialism  not a brilliant athlete so many workers were fury hardest read all of that called work with government said that the students are investigating on a toilet why do why should it go on our journalism well the way i on what is your or or whatever for the students were wrong you wouldn't have to send the police and soldiers that are you what are you saw that there are plenty of young workers like me who could beat the market will get is your opponent or similar sure to watch yourself but the students were right not sure they express were was in the hearts of was workers that's why we went out to support what's that i was really move that day students no doubt cardboard boxes for donations and i stuff money and i'm saying on that they got new york hang your that when he has revealed that when i saw the students were sweating thing works well i might have the for them i support of this demonstration because it was focused against one of the most fundamental the communist party maintains it's rule that is to accuse people of fabricated political crimes unless you that students showed real conviction show me honey that they put their lives and their future on the line the fight is unjust system  a thousand citizens will i started out with said i was very worried about the possibility of bloodshed pollutants want i kept telling the stories as that if we want to humphreys the police that we should not force are way past them i wonder what once has a clash with the police i was so intense that stuff people could have been on that that on after i was almost be washington with crowd that's what it was obvious tires of feelings were not order to beat people up just to the only try to find a hundred block haven't  still has met a little further assistance they continued their march toward channels square here's the thing as we're very pleased with themselves for break off and police them and the cheering of onlookers made them feel like real heroes the whole thing now turned into a corner and we always because there was no more dangerous and everyone was watching the susan big shot are you so that was how i felt the later that day and completely different from when i started out it had been an unprecedented in a mass student demonstrations held in the face of government warnings had been allowed to march peacefully through the streets and that very day the government announced that it was willing to talk what your meal what is haha in this eventually you both sides had made efforts to exercise restraint this unprecedented moment for them opened up new possibilities if only people understood what he meant sitting on them it's always a historical opportunity is often easily overlooked fuck what easily pass by his sister father unfortunately as a as just what happened i choosing your hands were gonna google does my had just arrived back in china and then point of those routes a me and i suggested to the students that there's not a good idea to continue staging huge demonstrations thongs it on the agree with that once we have shown your strength and evolution returned to class you and and try to secure some specific democratic rights campaign the mean do few students who are ready simply to go back to class but what should they do next one dumb gps you the triumph of april twenty seven would be the last moment in which all parties working for change were united those are the euphoria soon begin to fade and disagreements over tactics developed she's you know it has to have met him and represents shows a call for social justice ruth what for your sooner times and we have no choice but to take to the streets to express our ideas what and our anger and showing determination to change the the what the materials as april twenty with such a totally can sort out the students do to guy job and the government insofar as the to change it's usual behavior better about our ultimate goal is to change the entire system this cannot be accomplished by students day on the streets the students demanded that the government grant legal status to their new organization the coalition of independent student unions and talk with them as equals they wanted to way quad dialogue from each you're and one of the most important to manage raised by the students yours was for the government to have a dialogue with a little too hot to the news a good idea of dialogue come from actually jobs a young was the first to be unloaded not he said government leaders should engage in dialogue and ordinary davidson for a don't need go for the hardliners oppose this from the start and little to haunt it's absurd they said down which trimmed already in the people on one families aren't how kind of got and gonna go see with itself this yeah you're trying to imitate the west so they wouldn't even let as it was like learn to a while the way who are dialogue was a key part of the reformers strategy to open up the political system it was aimed at making officials at all levels more responsive to popular opinion the head of the party general secretary jauzion was a leading advocate of these reforms at the nineteen eighty seven party congress shall was finally able to get the principle of dialogue adopted as official policy but the have the entrenched party bureaucracy behave in new ways was another matter oh man would ya da da da on april twenty ninth the government held a meeting with representatives of the official student union of aging only a few of the new activists managed to get in un move was the government spokesman is was not the new more open faced the galaxy young wanted he spoke with the voice of standard party authoritarianism and he did most of the talking they want the independent student unions called this meeting or fraud surrounded by the media a student leaders made the rounds of government offices to present their conditions for further talks right now one government bureau a group from the countryside was trying to get their grievances heard grassroots democracy hadn't reached their village so they were doing what they've always done kneeling before the offices of the central government to beg for official intervention in their local problems they were having little luck getting any want to listen  the student said that unless the government accepted their preconditions for dialogue they would much again and i'm deborah i would how many to as around a lot walmart for me you go all day is your fears don't we yeah goes away swords the the on it a lot or here yah at your your east yours is the way though jingle all have audio so as you the to this you that he saw way god asia shows and than the out a way that sort of a while know some student activists were trying to institute elections and they were getting support on campus well i don't know why you know i you don't they don't feel that yeah don't  two elections on many campuses a student dialogue group was formed the students no change in tactics rather than demanding official recognition as a precondition for dialogue they were willing to talk right away and they wanted to talk about their constitutional rights trying to pass on as well the aim of dialogue was not to solve everything you want us do like about one teach him with we wanted to establish some ground near hawks the you got some open up some channels for the and one occasion you got chewed up he so that whenever problems arose their be way as of resolving to go to portland yes we teach you wouldn't you we whole new wanted to lay some foundations for the future he wanted to make a good start throwing okay now when we were hoping for it was gradual progress that thousand and as reform not cataclysmic change not revolution going on in and it's because honestly and nineteen eighty nine me situation wasn't so bad that people felt they needed a revolution a new have seem to be opening up a path leading away from the confrontational politics that had dominated china for decades the path china had long ago fail to take  on may fourth china celebrated the seventieth anniversary of the demonstrations of nineteen nineteen when patriotic students had first protested against an unresponsive governor there were two celebrations on that day the government sponsored commemorations at the monument and a to march from the university district to channel and square    a student saying a patriotic song in the nineteen thirties   oh wow i wow  in official communist party history the student protest of nineteen nineteen were but a prelude to the party's revolutionary make over of china but in fact many of the leading voices of the may fourth era smoke not for revolution but for democratic reform after their days of street protests many students went back to school took up there various professions and continue to work for social change those who saw no hope for reform joined the communist party to fight for an ideal society over the decades the voices championing gradual change would either stifled by conservative power holders are drowned out by cries for revolution by marching into tianamen square the students of nineteen eighty nine were saying to the party we are the true inheritors of the democratic legacy of the may fourth movement but the may fourth spirit they were most familiar with was the one the party have taught them third from working in the value system of the communist party revolution is placed at the time so comrades are called revolutionary of couples revolutionary couples and families revolutionary family everything that everything is revolutionary that don't want reform is not a good word and communist vocabulary so when we don't we were trying to do was to introduce the idea of the incremental change to the people of china why we were trying to tell them that recent war on was not a bad thing and that revolution often feel good rhythm promise once again the government had not suppress the march in fact the leaders at the top were deeply divided on how to deal with the protesters on the very day of the may fourth anniversary party secretary general jobs the on made a speech the departed surprisingly from the hard line april twenty six editorial and a nationally televised meeting with foreign bank or is joe told his audience that there was no serious turmoil in china do a why dialogue jo said was the solution to the present tension the students now debated should they go back to class and show support for this conciliatory attitude or did jealousy ons remarks indicate deep rifts in the central government that must be exploited by pushing harder going farther many students went back to class we're bahonar or michelle the on may eighth several leaders of the independent student union of my university came to see me yeah you you pete holmes yeah hi ultrasound they complained about the students who had returned to class and said they wanted the blockade the classrooms were on these yet was yeah to suck what i would use when i said i thought you were demanding democracy spending it to make a basic principle a democracy is the right of individual choice was or can deprive others of their choice how's that different from the way the communist party has always deprive you of your choice common your he had not even more so than that this was a problem they couldn't come up with any good arguments and response but they still felt uncomfortable i said then how can we get anything done you in china everything has always been handled this way katia only by prevent others from doing what they want you can you accomplish what you want the movement of beijing university also reached the low point more more students returned to class a lot of energy was wasted debating whether we should go back to class or not i felt increasingly frustrated or ordered would overhaul the weather time i thought we should resume classes because i felt a stalemate like this wouldn't necessarily get us anywhere in the students were pretty tired on may tenth one done gave an interview to a canadian television reporter on this movement whoever said that if you're a and are you guys i think that the student movement should move onto a new stage of her with asher no more a large scale and tenth street action no more boycotting classes instead we need down to earth work to build democracy on campus the legalization of student organizations independent student newspapers and radio station is and so on canada i don't push this work might not look all that grander glamorous or time but it's extremely important to that  and yet over the heads of the prominent student leaders still hung the people's daily editorial of april twenty six the shadow of don't go on that thread cut off any impulse toward moderation      once in your chair and i said how many years to political offenders get and someone said he used to be three years then it was increased to five years than seven and then seventeen years i felt very sad if i got seventeen years i'd be forty by the time i got out i really didn't want that to happen when you see how the closure on may eleven six of us discuss the situation replaced a lot of hope and talks with the government but they kept putting it on we feared that the movement would run out of momentum been the government would have been able to arrest the student leaders one by one and disband the independent unions video be op are you so it was necessary to escalate the movement for to use more radical methods are and apply more pressure to forced the government to concede to our demands negligible since demonstrations and sit down strikes no longer bothered the government we felt the next step should be a hunger strike will one done told me about the hunger strike and i immediately signed on then we try to persuade the leaders of the independent student unions a some of them more firmly opposed to a hunger strike i think they have a tendency towards opportunism as is so often the case democratic procedures were getting in the way of political action unable to achieve the consensus within the independent student unions the people in favor of a hunger strike bypass the new organization and made personal appeals to the students we show our on on the evening of may twelve try ling and i addressed the students would have been you know if she did most of the talking about over be daughter she said that the government was forcing us to put our lives on the line you will do that that she was crying emotionally this gotta everyone really stirred up on them i said we are staging a hunger strike in order to reveal the true face of the government and the true face of the people we want to see whether the chinese have any conscience whether there's any hope for china i said we are prepared to face death for the sake of true life because the oath written by our allies will brighten the skies of our country hello at noon on may thirteenth the hunger striker shared a last ceremonial meal the strikers one of the government to repeal the april twenty six editorial and hold televised talks with the students that morning the government had met one of these demands they agreed to talks with the dialogue group but by the time this news reached the university's the hunger strikers had already set out for tip and and then square  their declaration born in the tradition of romantic communist rhetoric was both heroic and deeply emotional it even included some lines from our youth this country is our country this people our people if we don't speak out the will if we don't take action who will at the height of youthful happiness and busey the hunger strikers proclaimed we must resolutely leave everything behind us mother china witness now the actions of your sons and daughters can you remain indifferent as hunger devours our youth and death approaches cause and yeah though   the  wow no a photo shop kendrick a okay times have you know i right about that what about like a dog    the hunger strike could not have come at a worse time for the government that week a historic meeting years in preparation was to take place the president of the soviet union mikhail gorbachev was coming to china a grand welcoming ceremony was scheduled to take the place enchantments square which was filled at the moment with thousands of students we're so husband talk about off a hot your say i'm a feeling of the government plan to welcome which off at him and square number potential to everyone knew that that the square would have to be cleared eating cheese no much yeah so the sooner we thought well if they say it's the hunger strikes their the government would definitely respond by making team i heard many students talk like this on the afternoon of may fourteenth less than twenty four hours before gorbachev's arrival the government began talks with the dialogue group the main official representative was the ending food a leading reformist minister some students who had initiated the hunger strike were also present work i feel was one of them or mission juvenile lot of the biggest victory of the whole movement or it was that our congress a stranger to force the government should have been negotiated are able to good to to earlier we demanded a live television broadcasts on the original but the government agreed only to a pre rick roy rogers so we made a concession on this you do we felt that a prerecorded broadcast was in itself a hard one achievement but the hunger strikers who are waiting at the square did not hear the is broadcast yeah lincoln trade many of them rushed to the meeting hall and disrupted the session the poor so the talks were running for the students themselves which is when we're she's the location or two times usually i felt that may fourteenth was a big setback for the student movement then there you go after this the students must many more opportunities by repeating the same mistakes are easy to do it it was the eve of gorbachev's arrival and talks between the students and the government had broken down what was shot when we speak of the government and i were talking about two kinds of people reformers who are in power at the time and the hardliners who oppose them that much the or in really normal was in a very precarious situation and came under constant attack non go back but like refineries here for social stability for iraq so that they could continue their difficult work them on the way the hardliners had been using all kinds of underhanded tactics sure that habit to get dung shopping to turn against the reformers and the chauffeur but they haven't seen much success or you'd rather than our meal so they wanted to create a massive crisis on order to get rid of the reformers as they had will ya bomb know got that idea   what you need your feet how much attention i was worried that reform would be derailed if that happens and all the grand slogan i think about democracy about abolishing dictatorship and so on would simply be a lot of hot air      that's well scholars journalists and critics who will known supporters of liberal reform in china and widely respected they all praise the students but called on them to change their tactics      teachers and students with a problem and means intellectuals was that they were playing the wrong role as i think they were acting is mediators between the students and the government remain of the government agree to face to face negotiations ten that this was the first time in forty years and we accomplished we the student usually acting as an independent political force i've got a team team and then when we invited the intellectuals to join us they came to the square and address doses children  yeah     haven't getting into the message we got from them was this interview people have gone too far you have to do this graduate was to your mommy and daddy listen to your government with well fall i have to say is what have you done that gives you the right to criticize us what other shows the truth spellers had made an accurate assessment of the situation and they were well intentioned a new this stalemate would harm the students cause but all the students who put so much into the hunger strike how could the government simply ignore us know if we left it would have been like encouraging a bully emotionally we couldn't accept that you can tell me all you want about what a rational person should do that i say excuse me i can't be that rational because i'm not facing a rational acknowledged portland i'm sure that we failed completely for down at the time i and we intellectuals caught between a totally irrational government and totally irrational students one for we do although most students were unimpressed by the intellectuals attempt at mediation some share their belief that gorbachev's visit would help the cause of reform in china as a last minute compromise work i see led the call to make room for the official welcoming ceremony for the soviet leader  mm   yeah    we really weren't willing we decided not to me because well i'll quote the words of a foreign reporters he said you are already on a hunger strike what more can they ask of you we assess the high to projecting on the night of the fourteen everybody was waiting for the clearing up the square jollity one that everyone was restless hi why aren't we comic good at why aren't they come in and some will have i told you that you don't know thousand and we're so eyes the on the morning as a my teens excellent of friends getting we both felt that the situation was very grim video watched if the government ignore the students on may fifteenth wish they would be put in a very awkward position so you for were they going to do and the on this isn't just right for lunch if the government and simply stand by and watch while the students live slowly waste away like this we will have to take even more drastic measures we will set ourselves on fire if the government is callous enough to see these children starve to death and i will be the first to die a i said this over the loudspeakers i said i was willing to be the commander in chief i don't remember my exact words that i said the only criterion for person to join the hunger strike leadership was a willingness to be the first to die so that other students could live on   the government chose to cancel the ground ceremony plan for tenements square gorbachev got only it could work at the airport the first visit to china by a soviet head of state since nineteen fifty nine and then upstaged by the students gorbachev met with party leaders like jauzion look to the soviet union as an example of political reform and with others my premier league hung who were wary of everything gorbachev representing both groups in the chinese government needed the backing of done champagne who was in charge of the military and thus held the real reins of power  by now the hunger strikers had been in the square for two days and their numbers were increasing constantly still there was no official response as time dragged on sympathy for the students and anger at the government grew what would the shooting will come and i couldn't even convince my on students delusion for anti female students cried whenever i spoke to them it's easier for me in the morning students are so young and you with only she has we're not pay for themselves and the bare ground hundred million the million from the it was really isn't i do that for their we were putting their young lives on the line sitting there stubborn functional what you read that the government was ignoring them a job i even got no i was moved out long time employees yeah so i decided to stay on the square and help the rather shoes you woman lodging a deity just show me how can we workers and ordinary people had been looking on kind that those year then usually student started the hunger strike like using their own lives to will weaken the whole nation so you do will fill new responsibilities and limos opportunity on may sixteenth while gorbachev continued his discussions with the chinese leadership three hundred thousand people marched in the streets of aging on the seventeenth and again on the eighteenth that number rose to one million people do  this yeah one  gg  hello  what are so high on i went for just square every day after may fifteen because a lot of students from my university were taking part in the hunger strike choice and i went there to help and a linguistics on to run errands landing lag i also prefer hot line to ensure that the ambulances move freely no the universe really students had been on hunger strike for nearly a week we're still the government paid no attention to them hundred go to work or the motta we said well now that what bastards you any son of a bitch would have acted better than dung shelter or leap on one moderate government leaders tried to defuse the mountain crisis the official media was allowed to report sympathetically on the hunger strike emergency medical teams were sent him to ensure the health of the hunger strikers actions like the suggested that the party line was shifting and nobody wanted to be left on the wrong side local party leaders and managers started permitting their workers to go to chan and then to show support for the students organized contingent started showing up carrying the banners of their workplaces is to participate you now was beginning to look not only right let's say   the spectacle was overwhelming highly photogenic the foreign press in beijing to cover the sino soviet summit walked into the biggest international media story ever recorded out of china what of what you see what time what a story gets why they bought a year and this is gentlemen square today it's of people squirrel like more than a million chinese demanding democracy and freedom and are blaming the new revolution unbelievable we all came here to cover solid and we walked into a revolution  we went and season it's a great feeling to get the attention of tens of thousands of people just before them when i was just assumes has been very depressed all of a sudden there were at center stage after that that people need it they felt the humor sense of the able to change history all these zombies amen this squealing was a boost to the egos and what's your appetite for more system you up doesn't mean there's never been a generation like ours is shown on their mocked the state top to mark the government when she mocked the leaders aren't you mail and there's never been a generation where the dizzying that the outside world then shown today and kind of so beautiful  with on new the we get so germans china's most famous singer he's saw nothing to my name's expresses our feelings because our generation have anything on the mean we don't have the goals are parents have on the a meal we don't have the fanatical idealism are older brothers and sisters one's head was showing yeah so what do we want nikon sheer nike shoe for me the should yeah lots of free time to take our girlfriends to a bar you to me the freedom to discuss the issue with someone who wouldn't you look good old and to get a little were special from society so because annoyingly difficult in this process there was something so pure so unforgettable you know there were also things i couldn't accept even things i found repulsive the your but they were all mixed together i'll just say what's in this history we could go it's history is this kind of process ones that there's no way to sort things out neatly possibilities for example during the hunger strike some students were actually eating probably will interests they felt that the hunger strike was only a means to an end not one our aim is to put pressure on the government so why should we make real sacrifice often that it was you will have one student was outraged and just as a you people are manipulating the public need some she's and guy said once you turn your sacrifice into a hoax you lose your moral integrity always think so he wrote and lucky i want to use my blood to defend the purity of the hunger strike have each issue that changes what have you got i was very wouldn't what you're gonna use this kind of the gesture my not have any significant political times that i you know that to me although he showed a deep sense of decency to always something that has become very rare in china during the days of mounting protest reformist officials face and and possible predicament they didn't have the power to make the concessions the students demanded yet they knew if they couldn't get the students to leave the square hardliners were more than willing to use force and the army had already been mobilized furthermore since the breakdown of the may fourteen talks it was no longer clear who really represented the students the only way to communicate with the protesters was to appeal directly to the crowds and the square on may sixteenth accompanied by student leader one dog the reformist official government through made such an attempt that's a nearby he was on the verge of tears oh my god he asked the students to give the party rumors more time or new to even went out on a limb to tell us that the problem of the april twenty six the dettori or would definitely be solved but it would take time time it was very sincere he said that the central committee had guaranteed the student activists wouldn't be persecuted he said if you don't believe me you can take me hostage than i said i hope everyone will consider this proposal carefully therefore i had the of the atmosphere was so highly emotional it was impossible for either of us to continue so you and me from the left only hours after yeah mean first appearance in the square a letter from galaxy on written on behalf of the central committee was broadcast in essence it contradicted the april twenty six editorial but the strike continues jenna you can get the following day premier league pong and summoned a group of student leaders to the great hall of the people are

jail je drunk energy of justice cut wages or coercion or marijuana your year good at all uk has a jesuit a lot or mediocre number of shows you a teacher when you get in the predawn hours of may nineteen a worn and hagrid jauzion appeared suddenly until tournaments queer joe have lost out to the hardliners in the party on the verge of tears he said to the students we have come too late we deserved your criticism joe the disappeared from public view go pack when the reformers were still in power that is to say before jobs the young was removed for was he was the most powerful person next to dine shopping usually students didn't accept any of jobs the and compromise they didn't want to cooperate with him in any way know each other once he was defeated it was the hardliners turn to show how they deal with things the government was now ready to declare martial law this news was leaked to the hunger strike headquarters ahead of time the students suddenly announced the end of their week long hunger strike and began a mass it in i'm an evening of nineteen premier league hung addressed an emergency meeting of state and army leaders his speech was broadcast as army units move toward the city you'll go so what changed all you done yet go daddy didn't initially new change tonga what i do so the chance to me to million yeah we do it  new speech only serve to incite the people with beijing st marie to he's got on their motorcycles calling themselves the flying tigers they sped to the square to report on troop movements  convoys were blocked by crowds of protesters and their supporters john you can you imagine jim carrey ago i can imagine it's any that's the db obvious reasons are going to go to lobby yeah region when you and ran away wow  the people's liberation army had entered beijing once before in nineteen forty nine it was a time when the pl a was will cities  the army was soon as the to people's army from the people of the people and for the deeper  the party said that the army was like fish and the people like water fish can't live out of water the feel a was the guardian of the state protector of the people in times of natural disaster the army was there to help fight floods fallon and fire  hardy propaganda promoted a popular image of the honor films fiction and stage productions celebrated the key away and created a pantheon of army heroes for mass consumption  i  in early nineteen eighty nine for dna received it's annual tribute in the chinese new year t v extravaganza            now forty years after being welcomed into beijing the army was coming again this time it came as an alien force on the morning of may twentieth martial law regulations were announced the police and the army were authorized to clear the streets but people ignore the government's orders the city was still jam with demonstrators helicopters were the only military vehicles moving   sanders tasteless this thread of armed repression students tried to mobilize even greater public support well well live the door them yeah for     just at the moment when the students most needed to support and protection of the mass movement a group of workers declared the sounding of an independent union they set up a public address station at the northwest corner of tenements square was it don't need i became a grudge against do people sent us amount of letters for the last forty years they've had been no channel for them to express themselves my broadcasting their letters we gave them influence so what do you do i do too there are many people luxury hundred two hundred up to really wanted to listen to something simple to rig and to the point for me where you grew up with a nanometer to for a yoyo the independent workers union not only put forth our own demands on your own few of thought about it also helped out the students by sending them food and water food veilleux treasure those without the people of beijing mushroom you may operating the workers the farmers from the outskirts of the city the movie and the streamer at all because you also software from the students could not resist along with your the know union help mobilize citizens to block the martial law troops for some forty eight hours the troops remain stuck in a sea of the paper moving their forward or back mcconnell you could you get on in georgia i saw a woman lying down in front of the military truck the order for her face was all wrinkles and she had no friday word and then are tired of iowa i saw all these ordinary people looking acting got out of political calculation or with any ulterior motive got an early out of sympathy and a sense of justice in confronting the troops to protect the students on tiananmen square from the i was very new guy who older disorders usually sometimes i was disappointed and how foolish and childish the students once a couple of them came to me to discuss their plans one claimed to be the commander in chief of students security guards the deed who do that tourist map and hand began to command to send me see here to the south of us there are such and such troops or the kind of the north of us there are such and such troops who the if i get all four points the compass couple she knew she she yeah and only only commit if you go on a ship i was you realize young be yeah would you pull these sounds ratios i was reminded of a movie i saw calling from victory to victory in the communist commander points to a map and says facing us or this many troops on our flag or that many troops and so on what are the upon i watch this kid carrying on like this and felt like laughing he said if we blockaded every intersection we'd be spreading our troops too thin i plan to concentrate our forces closer to the square i felt this matter of military command like a child playing at war came straight out of communist propaganda and i wondered what would you cannot get involved with isn't any good    the massive show of resistance to the army was successful the troops go back to the suburbs     the danger had passed people continue to pour into the streets  the workers had helped win a victory for the movement at the square but unlike the students their need to make a living hide them to their workplaces conway wouldn't have a union unrelated to the workplace is not really a union at all is that hammer guantanamo talk and yet here we were setting up the union it's yeah murray square inspired by a student what kind of future could possibly happen i can but there was no way we could organize and the factories it was either furthermore i knew that the movement is going to come to enhance soon the genre how we could do was to try to take advantage of the popular fervor to educate the workers on rules your to let them know that the constitution grants them all kinds of rights in the hospital none of which have been put into practice to my is our this way after the movement in the streets ended and things returned to normal some effects of the movement would still be felt jersey on your shiny you know what i mean here is an awareness of constitutional rights workers and peasants with know what rights they should enjoy each year drought they'd also know about the legal channels open to them so they can dump man those rights so huge on through the shiny  meanwhile among the students a struggle over tactics on folded one and some of us wanted to students to leave the square not only out of consideration for the student safety we also thought i was good tactics in egypt by leaving the square what we would have undermined the rationale for imposing martial law in that might have given the reformers in the government is have an opportunity many students do not understand that the square is our only stronghold some people have repeatedly advocated that we leave but that could only please the government what makes me really sad is that i am the commander in chief and i can't let go of this power because i must resist compromise resist these traitors the leaders of the independent student unions have beijing and of the provinces are all after my power in the intense atmosphere of the square the leaders with more radical agenda as had the advantage these were people who had come to prominence to the hunger strike they had not stood for elections on campus their credentials were a determination to make the greatest sacrifices their power base the continuing a claim of their followers they set up a new headquarters to defend tiananmen square what us more chai ling became commander in chief the commander had control of the loudspeakers the voice of the square that broadcast to the masses   the continued hardline pursued by the government would further undermine moderation and encourage a hard line among the students could take care i used to believe that we could establish democratic process and then a lot of people could use science to really help our country but now i've come to realize that unless we overthrow this inhuman government our country will have no hope our people will have no hope  ,"Gate_of_Heavenly_Peace,_The_(1995)_1Gtt2JxmQtg.wav"

that made sense let's talk about the for reprint because i don't know that would i needed to know that well with the film reprint it was called under the cherry moon and it would have things like my life as a picture and new gilded the frame things like that just fabulous to have to say but it was very interesting experience because i i don't see never made a film before and i was them a very young actress beings thrust into this world of of show and mega stars and it was a real eye opener can we talk about what players isn't actually the app ain't it was just it was just a mad world of of kind of fans a crazy fans and that of all night music things and it was just use long time ago for winded rebels and me we're gonna talk but will buy a which is what we're here to introduce purchase well we're here just talk about your group where did success really hit few where did you really feel there was a moment the and she became an actress of no to leader and actors that people had taken notice or still trying read your me where people to knew you were ah i think it was probably with four weddings and if you know i think that's what matters now i remember when they're when they then duncan can whether you might be had saving played any easier i'm when he rang me out and say we're number one the box office and i thought they meant the sort of local box hope you get but actually and it was a huge huge huge hit and and people still in stop me and told me about that film so and and it i know is on television recently and damn it's still find his audience and still people are enjoying it so that's great yes the you've worked extensively oversee him in in british films i'm in american films but also him in french film so and most interesting i was thinking in in french theater do you have a preference for working in english language or in french language i mean it's was your broad question but i just wonder why i think it depends on it depends on the subject it depends on what kind of film ones making i really like making really tiny little french films weather's you know the entire crew actors inc included as of twenty that's my i really like working like that really fast filmmaking am i can't bear that's huge films that go on forever we were shooting is like pulling teeth where everybody has to wait for the leading lady to appear and as a sort of huge status thing and hierarchy and i find that very exhausting was i'm never at job the arab and going for them but in terms of the language itself in terms of and says that i was a line well of english or french i use hundred well if i'm absolutely one hundred percent honest i think i prefer friends that i mean into his now i think i prefer english because it is because however well one speaks the language there is is tiny tiny tiny effort that is made even when you're not really conscious that you making it of he's concentrating on a and nation or concentrating on what that would really means or how to pronounce it is it is a kind of a little bit of a confusion it doesn't set of poor out the way it does an english i really i'm really supposed to say that because your french's your so bilingual him and and the work you've done in french is so nuanced i can't believe i would do for you work entirely with i don't i'm most proud of is a film and i made in romanian and i added a film called an unforgettable summer is terrible title but i'm and the unforgettable summer was a film made by loot and penta yeah who's this marvelous i'm romanian film director and theater director and he asked me to make a film with him in romanian and for some reason i said yes that's a really good idea and went off to make as film in romanian and and with the assurance that i would be dubbed afterwards but they they didn't up me so yeah i'm that's the thing i'm most proud of and really i didn't really know what i was saying not quite sure what that by my brief moment you're just drinking romania i'm speaking romania know i can't remember word which is that it phonetically i learnt it phonetically with many false unesco who is some eugene unesco daughter smart and she came every day for six weeks to sort of drill me in pronunciation him and how to a kind of you could say this convincingly it was very exciting as it it creates a whole different thing about about performance because it's not just the words know it becomes it kind of concentrates everything and and and makes it all about what you you can't you can't do anything clever with the lines you just have to say it exactly as it has it's written because you have no idea about whether you go up at the end of that sentence on whether that will make that you have no idea about the international or wasting a certain word or anything i that you just have to play the the them what your trying to communicate as an emotion or message or whatever it took here for language and and then screenplays and because i'm working with your nails are very aware of how you dissect to text and you want to their exactly everything from grammer to nuanced her everything is is to do with the turks were talking about this because we're to metal body which has to be when the great screenplays ever written but you're very very dedicated to guide the idea of a screenplay or or play that you in explore and and a bit here to the rules of a of a text of the weather's a play or screenplay i assumed her so for net it's over extraordinary level have you always done that i love going on to a project whether it's a screenplay or a play or whatever when you don't have to change anything in this month wonderful story about this actually because i think that some ms davis was renowned for arriving with a big yellow pat and she'd rewrite all the scenes as they came they week she can't say that she has said like this and to and this is the first time she didn't change a word and the screenplay so you know i sort of when i when i heard about that i thought ah newish coming from but better so if a bit guilty about trying to change things but sometimes if i say nowadays that sounds who but it is difficult to people tend to think that because it sort of real and modern and we're trying to be as realistic as possible that at any old actor can turn up and and change something and make it there's an average is actually really annoying because it was annoying to the actors because i like to know exactly what i'm having to do because then i can do it whereas if i have to think about how i'm going to say it anyway it's but not get but i'm i'm skating not the only one because she she was the same i was working for today with sons him you tubes last night and she was talking about how she never engaged or was involved in the idea of improvising she was never been involved in that method yeah america because the and through she just like to absolute zero punctuation say the lines would have exactly what the and where she was a writers actors in that sense and never got into oh well i'll do something like well the writers that she would always do exactly what the royal did you have a similar was for you to improvise you to make it up you just very specific about were right to wanted of how you might reflect will more i wasn't in the well that's what i tried to but is that your training if is my training don't know have you ever improve i have you ever been in situation you've had to improvise of a script to make it out beyond i absolutely hated her i'll bet you they do it next than you feel is being you and know it's sort of uncomfortable making and and if you like you've been caught with the pants down and is just awful they like this tool but this is what bette davis was saying is that cuba the same issues you say it's not about me slay i'm here to act the script they're like that is what acting is a milk here to be my so learned were much more like musicians than than people imagine is that you've got a a very precise series of words to say and the and the the interpretation is how are you know how you you put the new ass in there and you how how you can kind of manipulated slightly without changing anything and that's the important thing would without a an innate a is quite difficult a lot of the time to do that i think particularly in france actually when i've had them as or for problems because they don't dedicated enough time and money to script writing here because that this is this this culture of cinema daughter you know when you the director is also the the writer here and so it gets a bit mckee because see he perhaps isn't a very good writer it's also the same him in his i start you french theater but it's a the writer and peers her in refrigerators talk to the keyboard i would i disagree it's all about the director know though it is i know yet you're right it's more about disrupt our it is is you know you're right i don't disagree but i do nothing but it's it's often about the director's vision whatever that be whatever that means whatever that may i hope i have no idea what it means but don't means that a very long boring evening so we often have that and then but they are also obsessed with language as one particular director who actually quite enjoy called closure as he and he will have actors standing still staring out there and in a monotonous voice intoning the text which makes you listen to the text and it is sometimes my magical because there are moments when suddenly sons that takes off but a lot of the time you think my could be just reading this book reader have lot stronger but we go to but little buddy list the races are worse than i could hardly be she was for reasonable your last night which are seen before but i watched bigger lester why is this film serbs or really hard road roadwork well festival it deals with something that is makes everyone little bit uncomfortable wishes the aging actress and that something that i am very interested in good but have been for a long long long time so i think when i first audrey the i couldn't really intimate whatever and it made me the it makes me think of all cause an hour and a seagull it makes me think of that the sort of the shift in status which is so brilliantly observed admit it's the it's the relationship between theater and cinema in the nineteen fifties which is still relevant today i mean a lot of people die on stage know how do you do isn't when i'm i'm going off to theater how wonderful and there's a sort of competition between what which is more valid than the other there's an awful lot it it's just so modern lives just completely brilliant and it hasn't and the lie that the dialogue is really clever believable just the isn't one sentence that is superfluous it's all and they don't make it up they don't mean that so many films you watch these days where it's a little bit of this a little bit of that they come back to the right they do their own thing it's about that none of them it's richard lee done every word that is written is in the screenplay agree with that said is it was group images year when you get the long incredibly complex beaches that are incredibly sophisticated it's it's silver it's akin to new toward a force of the of the writer of the director and goes earlier and earlier and he does really long shots as well i take knew that he doesn't cut back and forwards see take long things and and as funny traveling chemistry sometimes have a little bit clunky that he said he was it just eight years he said that he wasn't to go you just in lenses all let malarkey he just interested in in in storyteller your language him and really was fascinated in how the complications of of the technique oh of his former formerly it's very interesting book ending of a of the film and and there is a very close sort of from double take home or what the film is day but in terms of just a simple scenes of it taken place in front of you so well written that will perform the they are and that but there's something else it strikes me now having because i first saw this twenty four years ago and i know that because i called because having watched it i thought i want to call my son joseph it said i was i was out here so much so i noticed twenty four years get but when i first saw it and i've lost my track now no i know if this thing about actresses always wanting to pay different roles and wanted to show that down a chameleon and i can do this and i can do that and which is i'm totally guilty of but in this film everyone is doing what they know how to do best whether it's some george saunders whether it's ritter what's the name sorry wow marita who's just being thelma rita it's what she's not being time as you being being she's performing the thing that she knows that there's no vanity about you know oh i can be different i can be as i can be even better am it's just doing what they now has do best so i think is actually rather interesting   ,All_About_Eve_(1950)_rqxgoPvFiuk.wav

Wallace_&_Gromit#_The_Best_of_Aardman_Animation_(1996)_1neY_Zh5mIs.mp4,,, we've got a call from a national film school saying we got his young student with us senor what can you come up and talk to her about animation and this was nick park and was working on a student film a small little call grand day out and by that time he shot not a lot of it i'm and really got to know him and we realize as a kind of kindred spirit is where you could see from the footage you done a ton of naturally gifted animator understanding of performance and the school was helping a bit but basically is lifters or devices or it's taking forever and and actually came down with a lot come help us do some off work it was it in the summer we paid him for that helped him through and we actually then helped him with a storyboard on grand a out helped him at at at that as china forgot going how to make a phone call of uncle babylon in the sweets is off the series which was produced bunker cutout hopkins for channel four was dealing with the sort of a nuclear holocaust sort of thing is quite heavy stop at this film was a based around the arms dealing annual conference or bunch of arms dealers in a dj is a be big night out and is a big political speech and about fifty characters myth that we can't possibly just animate those who had golly with us so if at your tell you what is get nick in in in that lab we met get him he can help out and we didn't do with the film school i still hadn't finished by this was five years into the film school and we said it will help nick finish him if you can we can bring his camera damned is set stone will help him finish if you can help us make this phone babylon and ah that was about not notify recent by the way we've got this is a fool to channel four it would you like to work on my those and nick been there was very interested in animals and birds and will be something that a zoo and he selected to do this from creature comforts because that part of the commission the generalize except was part of a commission jammy isaacs yes by this time he's also drawing to a close on grand out because wanted joined us we had some by that time it's modern makers are the with taghavi ah what's helped him through it and gave me more kind of structured approach the whole thing i'm and we ended up putting it into the oscars for him he had to offer free films in the oscars grand out and could conduct issue in nineteen eighty nine when of it was in fans running when you're ready oh this is a very important i'm in those laurel a slight lawsuit for poor and someone down people people in his old animals which yeah people on the world to kill people to or something to eat there was recently comfortable as baseless by spitzer ah i mean i feel more comfortable is if you're trying to hold back this situation so the environment that live a year with the government or of that to live in brazil there is a big difference here you live in a very much brief with to i'll live taking a lifeguard diverse possible you have a everything sorted out double glazing you know you're you're heating and every think in brazil but you don't have it be able to do you have faith how do you don't have all this technological you know that late and things like that and that you know now but you have faith and that we need his space to leave we need faith to feel that we are part of the war the not that kind of for be so of objective rocks the interesting about creature comforts which i'll never forget again nick was what what he animated kind of straight through we didn't use order for you for your video playback he just went for it and he says animating that janko or will add voice because it was so expressive no quite these things ever done but it just flowed out of him just it was so natural expression expressions there and i can remember we had a very small cutting room at the back of this building blessing up with had hoped to had the my current rating on the mac track getting the russia's we didn't send off to the lads until five shot whole chunk of stuff is quite scary and i can kind of thinking is up when we realizing that this is absolute magic it just went together so well it was quite uncanny and realizing this is what he's done here some very very special the impacts of creature comforts was phenomenal kind of breakthrough partially because it was partially because what china for were doing with putting out animated films from our audience of of a of a different level a different was they have taken away from the that of the joke children's bet you have it enters a model or go not what i don't know adult an unnaturally what came out of the woodwork one lot of extraordinary animators you the brothers clay as johanna quinn whole candy god whole bundle of a different mode of expression and for and it kind of creative this while kind of off for me they're completely different approach to what you could do the animation i nice a lot of the i miss the fresh meat you know because it was a we are predominantly can leave were not you know the thirteen and that we don't like potatoes we like neat really like a fresh meat    ,Wallace_&_Gromit#_The_Best_of_Aardman_Animation_(1996)_1neY_Zh5mIs.wav
"Wes_Craven's_New_Nightmare_(Nightmare_on_Elm_Street_Part_7#_Freddy's_Finale,_A)_(1994)_F6Dk9asJ0QY.mp4",,,hey my name is axel carolyn and the says wes craven's new nightmare i think that like everybody my age who likes horror movies i grew up watching freddy krueger or it nice being aware freddie krueger i don't think i've ever watched the first one until it was like maybe thirteen or fourteen but i remember hearing about new nightmare coming out and i remember it being at this festival in brussels where i was at the time and i couldn't go because i wasn't old enough to get in and and i just was obsessed with it and i was obsessed with that movie specifically and then i saw the nightmare on elm street series but completely in the wrong order a started with for and somehow i thought that for was amazing and then and then i saw one and was almost a disappointment because it wasn't as funny as for but then when i finally saw seven which was the last one i watched i think wicked that seemed first six i absolutely adored if it's it's a total classic part of them but one liners of i'm bringing up north of new to continue was dependent on the own more nightmare law fortunately i did so was prevents new nightmare came out ten years after the original so it's a return to wes craven to the series and he always said that he didn't like the sequels there's a line in the movie that says when the story die the nightmare set free which in the movie is supposed to mean that freddy is not contain and the sequels anymore so he set lose but it also kind of says that the story dies when it becomes too familiar or when it's not scary anymore which is very much a dig on the sequels by this point when he made the film freddie had become such a huge phenomenon that was grieving chose to do something very clever which is explore the french i as in the very postmodern way it's a reflection of the police of freddie and and the first film and film history and and pop culture in general in the movie freddie attacks it's creators he attacks heather day and camp and her husband and wes craven and robert england and john saxon and but she and and what's weird is that lynch a isn't there to she was in the first film but she plays a nurse he was play herself for some reason it's a script within the script the story unfolds as west rights it in the story which is kind of like scream a couple of years later would have a film within the film it's full of little throwback to the first film like those the opening with the claw and then there's the phone gag and there's a line screw your pass and there's a line whatever you do don't fall asleep there's a streak of white hair a nancy's hairdos the bbc sitters death food dyes like tina there's to gooey steps like him a nightmare and the first wonders love for the stretching arm all that is kind of is right there were two seen that there's a shadow that looks like nosferatu so the reflection goes beyond just a place of the film within the franchise but also of extends to other movies and references like nosferatu but also hansel and gretel and fairy tales and is really just kind of exploring what freddie means for people nowadays there's a lot of crossovers between reality and fiction which were kind of weird like here in the film has or can they and cam has a stalker and and realized she also did have one and also there's a lot of stuff about earthquakes in los angeles and it was shot the scenes of the earthquake were shot two weeks before northridge so it was one of those weird things have just shooting something and then the same thing happening very soon afterwards and they shot a lot of pick up shots that the into the some later on   ,"Wes_Craven's_New_Nightmare_(Nightmare_on_Elm_Street_Part_7#_Freddy's_Finale,_A)_(1994)_F6Dk9asJ0QY.wav"
